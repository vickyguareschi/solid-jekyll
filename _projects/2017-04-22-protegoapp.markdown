#### PROTEGO
Protego is a mobile app which it's purpose is to feel safe while moving from a location to another. You can add contacts when you are moving locations so they can see where you're at in the path you are taking, it lets you notify your contacts if you are feeling unsafe and it also has a panic button that contacts the police automatically. The project is currently on hold.
