#### PEQUENOS PUENTES
Pequenos Puentes is a NGO whose mission is to become a brodge between kids in need with people who are willing to provide them with school supplies, gift for Christmas, etc. The difference is that Pequenos Puentes asks the kids what is it that they wantor need, so that it's personalized. 

For Pequenos Puentes I am currently doing everything ad-honorem. I am currently working on a new Identity, and on the redesign of their annual campaigns.
