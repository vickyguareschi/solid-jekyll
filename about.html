            <h3>Hello World <3</h3>
            <br />
            <p>My name is Vicky and I’m a 26 year old design lover. </p>
            <p>When I was 15 my mom gave me a Wacom Graphire for my birthday and that’s when my love for illustration and design started. I am self taught in most things I’ve learnt on design, and I spend most of my time doing artsy stuff. </p> 
            <p>On my free time I like making drawings on illustrator, painting watercolors and taking pictures. I hope I can keep on learning more things, so that I can create better designs<3</p> 
            <p>I am currently working @ Volcom Argentina.</p>
